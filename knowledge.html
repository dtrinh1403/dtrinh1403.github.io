                        - Involves the creation of limited, custom-fitted clothing and accessories that are individual works of art. These pieces are usually one of a kind, with extreme attention to detail. <br>
                        -  French for “high dressmaking,” and originated with made-to-order garments designed and sewed for private clients. <br>
        
                        - Constructed by hand of an entire team of skilled designers in an atelier, or workshop. <br>
                        - The pieces can require several fittings in order to perfect and are usually made of the finest materials and expensive notions.

                        -  High-quality articles of clothing that are not hand-made but are also not produced in large quantities. <br>

                    - Limited availability, usually consists of more expensive materials and nuanced designs. <br>
                    - More attention to detail usually comes a higher price tag. <br>
    
                    - While luxury fashion items are still not as expensive as haute couture items, the prices are high enough to still give consumers a sense of being part of an elite market.

                        - More accessible, available for purchase by the public in large quantities, with variations in sizes to accommodate many more body sizes than haute couture. <br>
                         - A focus on producing attractive garments that appeal to the current market trends of the season. <br>
                         - Designers need to continually work to stay on top of current fashion trends in order to release multiple collections per year. <br>
                         - High Street fashion is also a term that generally applies to ready-to-wear clothing.

                        - The majority of apparel brand names that average consumers are familiar with are most likely fast fashion brands. <br>
                        - Fast fashion consists of mass-produced clothing with a very rapid turnover rate. <br>
        
                        - The desire to put trendy, marketable clothing on the market as cheaply as possible. <br>
                       -  These fashion designs usually jump from catwalk shows to retail hangers in a lightning-quick process.  <br>
                       -  Fast fashion design is less tethered to the idea of seasonal collections of clothing. While luxury and high-end ready-to-wear design houses will often release new clothing on a seasonal basis, fast fashion will frequently buck this trend and release multiple pieces every week. <br>
        
                        - Many of the designs created may be obsolete or out of style in only a few months. <br>
                        - Being claimed that the pieces produced are low-quality and encourage a culture of throwaway fashion. This trend results in items often only being worn once before being thrown away, 
                        resulting in a massive environmental and economic impact upon the world. <br>

                         - At the bottom of the fashion design hierarchy. <br>
                    -  The goal of most economy fashion is for the producer to turn a profit, so usually, the cheapest labor and materials are used. <br>
    
                    -  Economy fashion starts by producing an absolutely massive quantity of clothing, which will then be sold for a relatively low price. <br>
    
                   - The least environmentally friendly type of fashion design. <br>
                   - The very low-quality standards result in a short lifespan for garments. <br>

                    <p class="color-intro">
                        The color wheel was first invented by Sir Isaac Newton in the 18th century
                         when he tried to condense the color spectrum into a wheel and visually
                          represent the relationship between them. 
                          The wheel has been segregated into the following categories. 
                          While we will focus on using it for clothing and outfits,
                           this theory is universal and applies to just about anything 
                           that deals with colors.

                            <span class="fw-bold"> Primary Colors</span> <br>
                                 These comprise red, yellow, and blue.
                                  No two colors can be mixed to achieve these shades.
                                   Everything else is derived from these colors.
                         </li>

                             <span class="fw-bold"> Secondary Colors</span> <br>
                             Secondary colors are a combination of the primary colors.
                              So, red+yellow = orange, red +blue = purple, and blue+yellow = green.
                          </li> 
                          <li class="color-type">

                             These colors are a combination of primary and secondary colors. 
                             By mixing these colors, you get shades like mint, aqua colors, 
                             corals, etc.

                             <span class="fw-bold"> Warm And Cool Colors</span> <br>
                             Hues of colors like red, orange, yellow, brown, etc.
                              are warm colors – they make things look smaller in size, 
                              and that’s why most of us prefer wearing warmer colors
                               when we want to look slimmer. Cool colors, like hues 
                               of blue, purple, green, etc., are soothing colors.

                            Neutral colors are self-explanatory. 
                            They are just muted, plain, and subdued. 
                            Black, grey, whites, off-whites, taupe, etc., 
                            fall into the neutral category.

                            Red and green, violet and yellow, blue and orange – complementary colors,
                             as the name goes, work best when put together. 
                             These are exactly opposite to each other on the color wheel. 
                             They might seem bold to look at, but the outputs will be perfect. 
                             When you make bold color choices, both colors stand out.

                             If you observe carefully, your spring and summer clothing is mostly 
                             designed using complementary colors. 
                             While some might argue against this concept, 
                             it is actually a matter of choice as some like making bold statements.
                        </p>

                                Matching two or three continuous shades on the color wheel that blend well
                                 with each other is called analogous color matching. When you put an entire 
                                 outfit together based on this, it looks both striking and stylish. If you are 
                                 wondering how to style that orange or camel trench coat of yours, pick a shade
                                 on either side of the color in the color wheel and work with that.

                                 Analogous colors are next to each other on the color wheel and share a common hue. 
                                 When incorporating new colors into your wardrobe, find a color that feels safe to
                                  you—for example, light blue. On the color wheel, blue falls between teal and blue-violet. 
                                  If you feel comfortable with light blue, add on a teal or blue-violet for a subtle,
                                   two-color palette.

                                The combination of colors that are equidistant from each other on the color wheel is called ‘triadic.’ 
                                They look great together, but some might argue that they can be OTT. 
                                However, you can choose the muted shades of these colors to make your outfit.
                                 A pair of green cargos with a pastel pink top and powder blue accessories or
